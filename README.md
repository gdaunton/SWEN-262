## Usage
Install [JRE](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html) and double click on the .jar file

## Maven
This project uses Maven. This means you must have Maven installed to compile and run this program from source. Most Java IDE's include support for maven.

## Usage
Run the jar like you would any other.
On start up the program will ask you for a .csv file which is a list of all of the equities to pull from.
You can make your own or use [this one](http://www.se.rit.edu/~swen-262/design_project/ProjectDescription/equities.csv).
Once you have given it the .csv, it will show you the login screen.
